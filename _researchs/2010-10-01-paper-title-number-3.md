Standard factor models typically rely on a ``one-size-fits-all" assumption, overlooking the fact that pricing relationships vary across assets. This paper investigates whether assets exhibit group heterogeneity and adhere to the uncommon-factor model. Unlike common factors that price the entire cross-section, uncommon factors provide significant explanatory power only within specific asset clusters or macroeconomic regimes. Empirically, we find pervasive heterogeneity in risk premia across U.S. equities. We demonstrate that the ``factor zoo" is neither globally sparse nor stable; instead, certain factors command risk premia only in localized subsets while remaining irrelevant elsewhere. Leveraging Bayesian asset pricing for factor selection, our model significantly improves out-of-sample predictive performance and investment returns. Our findings resolve conflicting evidence regarding factor stability and emphasize that asset pricing is fundamentally state-dependent and asset-specific.
