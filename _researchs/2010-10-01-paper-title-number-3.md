title: "Asset Heterogeneity and Uncommon Factors"

permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Researchers typically seek new factors or develop new methods for the common
factor model when faced with the rejection of asset pricing tests. This paper in-
vestigates a different question: Are assets heterogeneous, and do they follow un-
common factor models? We introduce a tree-based framework that jointly clus-
ters asset returns and estimates heterogeneous factor models to analyze potential
grouped heterogeneity in the cross section using Bayesian priors. In this Bayesian
Clustering Model, we derive analytical marginal likelihoods as global split criteria
to incorporate economic guidance, address parameter and model uncertainties,
and prevent overfitting. Empirically, we find evidence of heterogeneity among
characteristics-managed asset clusters for the cross section of equity returns. Un-
like recent findings regarding sparsity in the factor zoo, we discover that some
factors are useful in certain clusters and are considered uncommon factors.'

Researchers typically seek new factors or develop new methods for the common
factor model when faced with the rejection of asset pricing tests. This paper in-
vestigates a different question: Are assets heterogeneous, and do they follow un-
common factor models? We introduce a tree-based framework that jointly clus-
ters asset returns and estimates heterogeneous factor models to analyze potential
grouped heterogeneity in the cross section using Bayesian priors. In this Bayesian
Clustering Model, we derive analytical marginal likelihoods as global split criteria
to incorporate economic guidance, address parameter and model uncertainties,
and prevent overfitting. Empirically, we find evidence of heterogeneity among
characteristics-managed asset clusters for the cross section of equity returns. Un-
like recent findings regarding sparsity in the factor zoo, we discover that some
