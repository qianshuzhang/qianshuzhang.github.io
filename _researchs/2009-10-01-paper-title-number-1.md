excerpt: 'This paper investigates the time-varying impact of U.S. macroeconomic regimes on the risk factors driving currency return dynamics. We introduce a novel regime-switching model that endogenously identifies regimes based on thresholds of macroeconomic variables. The empirical analysis provides robust evidence of regime shifts in the currency risk-return relationship, with U.S. inflation and interest rates as crucial variables defining three economically interpretable regimes. The Carry factor is pervasive across all regimes, whereas the importance of other factors (e.g., Value and Momentum) varies between regimes. Finally, we identify a regime risk anomaly that appears related to macroeconomic regime uncertainty risk.'

This paper investigates the time-varying impact of U.S. macroeconomic regimes on the risk factors driving currency return dynamics. We introduce a novel regime-switching model that endogenously identifies regimes based on thresholds of macroeconomic variables. The empirical analysis provides robust evidence of regime shifts in the currency risk-return relationship, with U.S. inflation and interest rates as crucial variables defining three economically interpretable regimes. The Carry factor is pervasive across all regimes, whereas the importance of other factors (e.g., Value and Momentum) varies between regimes. Finally, we identify a regime risk anomaly that appears related to macroeconomic regime uncertainty risk.
