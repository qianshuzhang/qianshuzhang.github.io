excerpt: 'We develop a novel approach for identifying the pricing kernel with the optimal set of traded and nontraded factors. Our approach is based on a formulation of the beta-pricing model that includes cross-sectional pricing restrictions, augmented with a model of all candidate factors. Tailored black-box Bayesian methods are used for single-step estimation, and model comparison is based on marginal likelihoods. This framework generalizes existing approaches that are limited only to traded factors, mitigates overfitting biases in investment and asset pricing criteria, and effectively screens out weak factors. When applied to many published factors, the selected optimal models consistently include only traded factors.'

We develop Beyond Beta Pricing (BBP), a Bayesian generative learning framework for discovering stochastic discount factors (SDFs) in theory-constrained financial environments. BBP reframes SDF selection as probabilistic model discovery over a combinatorial set of factor subsets. Using Bayesian marginal likelihoods as evidence scores, the BBP learner performs automated model discovery to identify the most probable and parsimonious SDF consistent with the data and the no-arbitrage principle. Applied to U.S. equity returns with empirical-Bayes type priors, posterior mass concentrates on SDFs spanned by traded factors. Out-of-sample validation confirms that the BBP-learned SDF delivers superior risk-adjusted performance.
