title: "Beta-pricing Models with Traded and Nontraded Factors: A Unified Framework for Estimation and Comparison"

category: working_paper
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'We develop a novel approach for identifying the pricing kernel with the optimal set of traded and nontraded factors. Our approach is based on a formulation of the beta-pricing model that includes cross-sectional pricing restrictions, augmented with a model of all candidate factors. Tailored black-box Bayesian methods are used for single-step estimation, and model comparison is based on marginal likelihoods. This framework generalizes existing approaches that are limited only to traded factors, mitigates overfitting biases in investment and asset pricing criteria, and effectively screens out weak factors. When applied to many published factors, the selected optimal models consistently include only traded factors.'

We develop a novel approach for identifying the pricing kernel with the optimal set of traded and nontraded factors. Our approach is based on a formulation of the beta-pricing model that includes cross-sectional pricing restrictions, augmented with a model of all candidate factors. Tailored black-box Bayesian methods are used for single-step estimation, and model comparison is based on marginal likelihoods. This framework generalizes existing approaches that are limited only to traded factors, mitigates overfitting biases in investment and asset pricing criteria, and effectively screens out weak factors. When applied to many published factors, the selected optimal models consistently include only traded factors.
